This is a project with examples from OpenGL 'The Red Book' (http://fly.cc.fer.hr/~unreal/theredbook/)

Examples are not exact copies and they are also modified to use GLUT instead of "aux.h".
I only tried this examples in OSX although they should work on other platforms too.
Examples depend on OpenGL and GLUT frameworks.
